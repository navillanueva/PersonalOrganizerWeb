# PersonalOrganizerWeb (MyPO)
Personal Organizer is a webpage where you can keep track of your activities, events and more. Programmed with HTML, CSS and Javascript for Users Interface course in 2019.
This was a group project made with Javier Sanchez and Fan Wu Zhuo

*Explanation*

The code has two webpage screens, the first "initial" is what a user will find when he first accesses the website. Here we have basic introducion videos, a page footer with contact info, privacy policys and more common stoof you should find in a website´s footer.
The design isn´t too pretty, we were asked to focused more on functionality for this project. A very basic little try on making a website. My first time programming with all HTML, CSS and JavaScript was at first pretty easy but then got harder. Enjoy!
